This repository contains the source code for my "Tugas Akhir" at Telkom University "Recognition of Balinese, Javanese, and Sundanese Scripts Using CNN with VGG-16 Architecture".

The goal of this project is to build a model that can recognize characters from traditional Indonesian scripts such as Balinese, Javanese, and Sundanese. The model is trained using a convolutional neural network based on the VGG-16Â architecture.
